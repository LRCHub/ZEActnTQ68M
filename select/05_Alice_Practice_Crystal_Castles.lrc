[00:03.35] Hi!
[00:04.85] 
[00:14.55] Scars will heal soon
[00:20.68] The dregs in us spent the earth down
[00:38.68] 
[00:58.32] Better than drowning in a burlap sack
[01:05.02] I live, as Alice, I die
[01:13.32] Children shouldn't play with dead things
[01:16.85] Foaming crows tear at their wings
[01:20.87] Sad eyes cry crimson blood
[01:33.87] 
[01:57.22] Drop it, it's dead
[02:00.52] Wheels won't turn, they won't turn the birdy's head
[02:06.14] Sad eyes
[02:10.14] 
[02:11.22] Sad eyes like sharpened daggers
[02:15.27] You'll never walk, only stagger
[02:18.62] Sad eyes, quite cryptic
[02:22.63] Bye
